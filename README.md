Dropbox sample code for Corona SDK

Hey Folks, I just created an all new version of the Dropbox sample code. This version is fairly straightforward compared to the last. It will allow you to request a token, authorize, get and store the access token and then it will allow you to download a .CSV file. I'm working on improvements so that it will allow the download of images or PDFs and uploads as well. 

I'll also be adding some documentation to help out soon.

For those of you that have been waiting for Corona SDK Dropbox capability, I can save you dozens of hours of time (that's what I've put in!).  Please consider making a donation if you find that this to be useful:
